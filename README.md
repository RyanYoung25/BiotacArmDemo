BiotacArmDemo
=============

This is a ros package that will launch a demo that bends hubo's elbow in response to the pressure that the biotac receives. Very similar to the two arm sound demo but a nice package that can run the entire demo from one ros launch. To install it, export your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH with the path to this repo. Then rosmake biotacArmDemo.
